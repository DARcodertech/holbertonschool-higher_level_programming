How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
===========================

This module defines the `text_indentation` function, which processes a text and adds two new lines after every `.`, `?`, and `:` character. It ensures no spaces are left at the beginning or end of the resulting lines.

Usage
=====

Basic usage:

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Hello. How are you? Fine: great.")
    Hello.

    How are you?

    Fine:

    great.

::

    >>> text_indentation("A single sentence.")
    A single sentence.

Error Handling
==============

Type errors:

::

    >>> text_indentation(42)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

Spaces Handling
===============

Handles extra spaces properly:

::

    >>> text_indentation("  Leading spaces should not matter.   Extra?")
    Leading spaces should not matter.

    Extra?

    >>> text_indentation("Text : with spaces.   ")
    Text:

    with spaces.
